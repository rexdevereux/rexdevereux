Hello, I'm @rexdevereux
I'm interested in using data science to explore finance, business, geography, economics, and history, and the connections between them.
I'm learning machine learning methods using python and enjoy writing in python. I also have practice in R, HTML, CSS and flutter for app development. I want to find interesting insights in the world, and create useful products.
